# hk-taxi-Q — Agent Instructions

Arcade taxi game set in Hong Kong, built from HK government open geodata.

**Read `docs/` before starting any task.** These decisions are settled — do not re-litigate
them without explicit instruction from the user.

## Locked decisions

| Decision | Value | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Engine | **Godot 4.7**, Mobile renderer | Commercial mobile app target; native perf; MIT, no royalties |
| Physics | **Jolt** (Godot default since 4.4) | Wheeled vehicle controller built in |
| Language | **GDScript** (not C#) | C# web export is unsupported, and iOS/Android C# export is experimental. See `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`. |
| ETL | **Python 3.11+** (GDAL/OGR, geopandas) | Best geodata tooling; runs offline at build time |
| Building source | **3D Visualisation Map (non-textured)** + **3D-BIT00 Level 1** | Already flat-shaded extruded volumes — the low-poly look is native to this data |
| Region (PoC) | **Wan Chai → Causeway Bay**, ~1.5 km² | Natural circuit, diegetic map edges, moderate Z-complexity |
| Art direction | Low-poly flat-shaded; **accurate city, toy vehicles** | Recognisability requires accurate massing; charm comes from the cars |
| Monetisation | Free download + one-time unlock IAP | Deferred to launch; affects only the free-slice boundary |

## Hard rules

1. **Never use the tile-based photogrammetry mesh** for buildings. It has ground gaps, level
   differences, and vehicles baked into the geometry. A prior public attempt found it unsuitable
   for driving. See `docs/DATA_SOURCES.md`.
2. **ETL is build-time only.** The game makes zero network calls at runtime. Never couple the
   game to a government API.
3. **ETL stays city-agnostic.** CRS, source schemas, and bounds live in
   `etl/config/cities/*.yaml`. Never hardcode `EPSG:2326` or Hong Kong bounds in pipeline logic —
   the second city is the business case.
4. **All tuning values are data**, not constants in code. Handling curves, fare timers, road
   widths → Godot `.tres` resources or JSON.
5. **Respect the data contract** in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`. ETL output and game input are a
   versioned interface; change both sides together and bump `schema_version`.
6. **Attribution is mandatory.** The credits screen must acknowledge the Government of the HKSAR,
   the relevant departments, and DATA.GOV.HK. See `docs/DATA_SOURCES.md`.
7. **Never use the phrase "Crazy Taxi"** in any user-facing text, store listing, marketing copy,
   or ASO keyword. It is a SEGA trademark. Use it only in internal docs as a genre shorthand.

## Conventions

- Python: `ruff` for lint/format, type hints on public functions, `pytest` for tests.
- GDScript: `snake_case` files and functions, `PascalCase` classes, static typing (`var x: int`).
- Generated assets go to `game/assets/generated/` and are **gitignored** — they are build output.
- Hand-authored assets go to `game/assets/authored/` and **are** committed.
- This is not a Node project. Do not run npm/npx/node commands.

## Before marking work done

- Python changes: `ruff check` and `pytest` pass.
- ETL changes: the pipeline runs end-to-end on the Wan Chai config without errors.
- Godot changes: the project opens without script errors and the target scene runs.
- Update `docs/PROGRESS.md` — task status, plus any new decision or open question.

## Where to look

| Doc | Contains |
|---|---|
| `docs/DATA_SOURCES.md` | Verified datasets, formats, licences, CRS, known issues. **Read before touching ETL.** |
| `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` | Stack, repo layout, data contract, performance budget, runtime systems |
| `docs/GAME_DESIGN.md` | Core loop, fares, scoring, controls, HK authenticity mechanics |
| `docs/ART_DESIGN.md` | Visual direction, palette, shaders, LOD policy, hero buildings |
| `docs/PLAN.md` | Phased task breakdown with acceptance criteria |
| `docs/PROGRESS.md` | Live status, decision log, open questions |
