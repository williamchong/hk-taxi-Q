# hk-taxi-Q — Agent Instructions

Arcade taxi game set in Hong Kong, built from HK government open geodata.

**Read `docs/` before starting any task.** These decisions are settled — do not re-litigate
them without explicit instruction from the user.

## Locked decisions

| Decision | Value | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Engine | **Godot 4.7**, Mobile renderer | Commercial mobile app target; native perf; MIT, no royalties |
| Physics | **Jolt** (Godot default since 4.4) | Stable trimesh collision and raycasts under the custom vehicle controller. ⚠️ *Not* for its built-in `VehicleBody3D` — `P0-5a` measured that and rejected it; `VehicleWheel3D` friction is isotropic, so it cannot express a drift that breaks lateral grip while keeping traction |
| Language | **GDScript** (not C#) | C# web export is unsupported, and iOS/Android C# export is experimental. See `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`. |
| ETL | **Python 3.11+** (`pyogrio`, `pyproj`, `numpy`) | Best geodata tooling; runs offline at build time. `pyogrio` ships its own GDAL, so no system install. **No geopandas** — `gdb.py` wants coordinate arrays, and GeoDataFrames would add pandas to reach the same numpy underneath |
| Building source | **3D Visualisation Map (non-textured)** + **3D-BIT00 Level 1** | Already flat-shaded extruded volumes — the low-poly look is native to this data |
| Region (PoC) | **Wan Chai → Causeway Bay**, ~1.5 km² | Natural circuit, diegetic map edges, moderate Z-complexity |
| Art direction | Low-poly flat-shaded; **accurate city, toy vehicles** | Recognisability requires accurate massing; charm comes from the cars |
| Monetisation | Free download + one-time unlock IAP | Deferred to launch; affects only the free-slice boundary |

## Hard rules

1. **Never use the tile-based photogrammetry mesh** for buildings. It has ground gaps, level
   differences, and vehicles baked into the geometry. A prior public attempt found it unsuitable
   for driving. See `docs/DATA_SOURCES.md`.
2. **ETL is build-time only.** The game makes zero network calls at runtime. Never couple the
   game to a government API.
3. **ETL stays city-agnostic.** CRS, source schemas, and bounds live in
   `etl/config/cities/*.yaml`. Never hardcode `EPSG:2326` or Hong Kong bounds in pipeline logic —
   the second city is the business case.
4. **All tuning values are data**, not constants in code. Handling curves, fare timers, road
   widths → Godot `.tres` resources or JSON.
5. **Respect the data contract** in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`. ETL output and game input are a
   versioned interface; change both sides together and bump `schema_version`. Bump where a consumer
   would be **wrong** to keep its old interpretation — not wherever bytes change.
6. **Attribution is mandatory, and it is stronger than naming a source.** The credits screen must
   acknowledge the Government of the HKSAR, the relevant organisations, and **both** DATA.GOV.HK and
   the CSDI Portal — including their **ownership of the intellectual property rights**. Draft text in
   `docs/DATA_SOURCES.md`; the operative terms are quoted in `LICENSING.md`.
7. **Three licences, three owners.** Code is GPL-3.0-or-later, hand-authored assets are CC BY-SA 4.0,
   and the generated city data is **nobody's to relicense** — it stays under the government terms and
   is never committed. Contributions come in under MIT so store builds stay possible. `LICENSING.md`.
8. **Never use the phrase "Crazy Taxi"** in any user-facing text, store listing, marketing copy,
   or ASO keyword. It is a SEGA trademark. Use it only in internal docs as a genre shorthand.

## Conventions

- Python: `ruff` for lint/format, type hints on public functions, `pytest` for tests.
- GDScript: `snake_case` files and functions, `PascalCase` classes, static typing (`var x: int`;
  `:=` counts). `gdformat` owns layout — do not hand-format around it. Untyped declarations fail
  the build, so this is enforced, not advisory.
- Generated assets go to `game/assets/generated/` and are **gitignored** — they are build output.
- ⚠️ Opening the Godot editor or running an export rewrites `game/project.godot` and
  `game/export_presets.cfg`, stripping their comments. Never commit either as a side effect; see
  `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for how to restore and verify. Headless `--import`/`--script` are safe.
- Hand-authored assets go to `game/assets/authored/` and **are** committed.
- This is not a Node project. Do not run npm/npx/node commands.

## Before marking work done

- Python changes: `ruff check .` and `ruff format --check .` **from the repo root** (the root
  `ruff.toml` extends the ETL rules to `tools/*.py`; running ruff from `etl/` skips them), and
  `pytest` from `etl/`.
- ETL changes: the pipeline runs end-to-end on the Wan Chai config without errors.
- Godot changes: `tools/check.sh` passes, and the target scene runs. The script covers formatting,
  the import, the GDScript warnings sweep and the verify tools. **Do not run those by hand
  and read the output** — Godot exits `0` even when a script fails to parse, so only the script's
  exit code means anything. See `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` "Checks".
- Road-surface, deck-height or ground changes: also `tools/deck_error.py`, `tools/overhang.py` and
  `tools/ground_clearance.py`, by hand after a build. They grade the *shipped* bundle and share no
  code with the pipeline — `check.sh` does not require a built region and should not start requiring
  one. Moving the road moves what the last of the three measures, so it is not only a ground check.
- Update `docs/PROGRESS.md` — task status, metrics, risks, and the open-questions index.
- Record any new decision, or any question that closes, in `docs/DECISIONS.md`, keyed by its ID.
- **Bundle size is measured from a PCK, never summed from source files.** That rule has been wrong
  in both directions once each.
